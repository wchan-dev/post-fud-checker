Programming requires creativity and the ability to approach problems in unique ways that AI can't quite replicate and won't for a very long time.\n\nChatGPT and other AI models can produce functional, impressive-looking code, sure. But that code can include outdated methods or technologies, solutions that just don't quite fit the problem, or straight up fundamentally wrong concepts. In the current state of AI, it's impossible to trust it to create fully functional code that checks all of the required boxes alone. Even if you told AI to write all of the code for a project, you'll still need to be there to clean up all of its mistakes.\n\nProgrammers aren't going anywhere. If programming is your passion and you have a knack for it, stick with programming.",

        "body": "When I think about the AI argument, I first think about technology as a whole and it's anthropological placement in human history. What is technology? It is a tool. Tools has been used through out history. When the flint was invented it replaced two sticks. When the matchstick was invented it replaced the flint. When the lighter was invented it replaced the matchstick. When the electric stove was invented it replaced the lighter.... so and and so fourth. \n\nThe point here is not just that technology continually evolves but that at every stage of invention, there will always be a new learning curve. At every intersection of these new begininnings are opportunities for individuals to capatilize on said technology; to start businesses, become experts in the field, and specialize in whatever new emerging technology presents itself. \n\nThis seems to be the one constants that exists in the field of technology that is not as prevalent in other fields. Will technology transform every sector in someway shape or form? Yes! But that is why I think that it I better to be at the center of that transformation rather than in its wake. AI will most certainly increase the speed at which jobs are replaced and it will also lower the barrier for entry of new occupants, meaning there will be more supply of workers and thus more competition for jobs if jobs in tech do not also grow simultaneously. \n\nAt the same time, AI takes away alot of the mundane and monotonous takes from the plate of the developer so that they can actually focus more clearly on bigger picture items. Not only that, but having more new occupants means th a t there's more opportunity for innovation. More innovation means more code, more time and energy that someone has to put in to making that new widget.",
